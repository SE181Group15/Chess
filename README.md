# Chess Game

ChessGame is a GUI Program to play chess both locally and online. The game can be played against another human player or against the computer.

When playing against another, you have the option of playing on the same computer, or playing online. The GUI game supports all features of traditional chess.

## Run

Launch the game from the JAR file in 

```bash
out/production/artifacts/chess.jar
```

## Play

You have the option to play against AI, or against another human player. Playing locally is supported by 2 player > Local menu, while playing online is to be done by choosing the 2 player > Create/join menu. 

When playing online, you'll need to share the UUID so that the other player's session can be detected by the server.
