##Running

We used IntelliJ IDEA ultimate with Java 8. In order to run our game yourself you will need to download IntelliJ and load in this project folder. Then simply run Main.

##Gameplay
In order to play the game we have a few options. 
If you want to play by yourself against the computer first select "1 Player" and then select your difficulty
If you want to play against another person first select "2 Player". Then you can either choose to play "Local" if you are using 1 computer or have 1 player select create and the other join on their computer.
